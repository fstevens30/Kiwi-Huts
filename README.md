## Course Outline

The aim of this assessment is for students to demonstrate their ability to evaluate, select and
utilise techniques and tools used in the development of interactive media projects.

The purpose is to document your understanding of the characteristics of the various forms of
media and apply appropriate techniques to prepare them for use (e.g. audio, video, graphics,
images, text, and animation), as well as design and development concepts and techniques
such as storyboarding, wireframes and user experience. You will document the project
proposal that will be the target for your research and choice of techniques and becomes the
outcome for Assessment 2 in the second half of the course.
