# Kiwi Huts

Kiwi Huts is designed to help you explore the many great back country huts available in New Zealand.

- Explore all huts on the map, see where they are located and what other places of interest are nearby.
- Mark huts as completed and track your progress across all the huts across the country.
- Save huts for later viewing, there are some very unique ones out there!

Data is sourced from the Department of Conservation and updated daily, however please consult the DOC website before heading out on adventures for the most up to date information.
